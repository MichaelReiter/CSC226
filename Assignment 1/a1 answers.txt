
1) What is the ZO sequence produced from the tree on page 396 if we look at it in a vertical mirror (i.e., flip it over on the page)?

1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0

2) In the code for build given in ZOrep, as a function of N, 
(a) how many times is k incremented?  2*N+1 (N is number of nodes)
(b) how many times is build() called in total?  2*N+1 (N is number of nodes)

3) What is the FL sequence for the "ordered" forest for the two tree forest shown at the bottom of page 225?

3 2 1 1 1 0 2 1 1 0

4) Exercise 1.5.8 in the book, except, instead of giving a counter-example, give a one sentence explanation of what can go wrong.

id[p] will eventually be overwritten with the value id[q] resulting in the if-statement checking the wrong value after p is passed.

5) Exercise 1.5.9 from the book.
