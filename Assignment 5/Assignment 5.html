<H2>Assignment #5:</H2>

<B>Programming part:</B>

<P>
In this part of the assignment you will get practice in recursive backtrack programming
and with some of the Java bitwise operators.  Your objective is to write a program for solving mazes
and for counting the number of solutions to a maze.  We supply the code for creating a
good-looking random maze.

<P>
We will think of the maze as being stored in a two-dimensional array
<TT>m[][]</TT> of integers using the explanation given below.
Take a look at the output further down for other examples of mazes
using this encoding.

<PRE>
/*============================================================*/
//      8
//    1 * 4    <-- encodings of various directions around a cell
//      2
//
//      +--+--+    +--+--+
//      |     |    |11 12|    11  12   a maze and its representation
//      +--+  +    +--+  +
//      |     |    |11 06|    11  06
//      +--+--+    +--+--+
//
//     16 16 16 16   initial maze contents returned by constructor
//     16 15 15 16
//     16 15 15 16
//     16 16 16 16

</PRE>

A template for your program may be found here:
<A HREF="ProgramTemplate.txt"><TT>ProgramTemplate.txt</TT></A>.
You should understand the code in this template before
writing any code of your own.  Some aspects of the code form
part of the written questions below.  Note that a random number
generator is used to produce the maze and knock down walls.
A seed is provided to the generator, so that we can reproduce
exact mazes over and over.

<P>
You should not change any of the code unless there is a comment
asking you to.  As always, you can add additional methods.
You should not need any additional classes.

<P>
With the main as provided, <TT>java Maze 3 3</TT> should produce the output shown below.
Make sure you understand how the numbers correspond to walls.
In the second output one wall has been removed, and there are now
two possible solutions.  The third output shows the solution to the
first maze; each cell along the solution path has 16 added to 
the initial cell number.

<P>
NOTE: Each solution path is between the upper left corner and the
lower right corner.

<B>Written part:</B>

<P>
These first problems are related to the code above.

<ul>
  <LI>Explain what <TT>Create</TT> is doing.  It is guaranteed to generate a maze that always has
  a unique solution.  Why?
  <li>If there are $n$ rows and $m$ columns, then how many times is <TT>Create</TT> called when
  making a maze?
  </li>
  <li>What is the purpose of the <TT>p^2</TT>?
  </li>
 </ul>

<B>Additional written part:</B>

<UL>
<LI>
From the backtracking handout: Question 2 about estimating the size of the tree.  Compare with the
actual size of the tree.
<LI>
From the book: Exercise 6.38.
<LI>
Find the max-flow and min-cut in the attached network as it
would be found by the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.
</UL>

<B>Optional written part:</B>

<UL>
<LI>
The linked <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/2016/03/mathematicians-discovered-prime-conspiracy/">article</A>
recently appeared in Wired.  Note the reference to computing the expected number of
flips of a fair coin to first get a HT and to first get a HH.  You should have no trouble computing one of
these values although the other is more difficult.  Do it!
